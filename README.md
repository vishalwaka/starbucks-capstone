## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in knowing how people respond to offers sent to them:
I want to build a model that predicts whether or not someone will be influenced by an offer.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

The data is contained in three files:
* portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
* profile.json - demographic data for each customer
* transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@vishalmadheshia/can-we-guess-what-offers-influence-customers-at-starbucks-3bc9463d6f64).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Starbucks for the data. Feel free to use the code here as you would like!

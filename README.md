## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in knowing how people respond to offers sent to them:

1. Which offer type do people respond to most?
2. Do elder people use offers or not?
3. Do higher income people use BOGO (Buy One Get One) offer more than other offers?
4. What percentage of people complete the offer without seeing the offer??


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@vishalmadheshia).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Starbucks for the data. Feel free to use the code here as you would like!
